Whitesource,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>Whitesource is another tool we're leveraging to scan our dependencies, licenses, docker images and more. We're in the early phases of rolling out this platform as we transition from Assess to Trial in 2021</p>"
AWS Codepipeline,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,<p>AWS Codepipeline is a tool that we continue to experiment with and assess to see if we can provide a completely native aws CI/CD process with all the features we want </p>
AWS Codedeploy,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,<p>AWS Codedeploy is a tool that we continue to experiment with and assess to see if we can provide a completely native aws CI/CD process with all the features we want </p>
AWS AppMesh,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>AWS AppMesh is a network routing service we're continuing to explore to see if it can provide the features we want such as (secure data in-transit, circuit breaker, retry, routing) and to see if it could help reduce the costs of deploying so many application load balancers. As priorities/resources align we will likely look into this more in 2022</p>"
AWS CloudMap,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,<p>AWS CloudMap is a service discovery platform that is often used along with AppMesh to help with the dynamic nature of discovering how to communicate with a given service</p>
AWS Amplify,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>AWS amplify is a great tool for prototyping and getting started quickly. However, we've found that the magic winds up getting in the way once you need to start making updates to applications as they evolve over time. We prefer AWS CDK instead.</p>"
AWS CloudFormation,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>AWS Cloudformation is a declarative infrastructure as code platform that we leverage to provision shared infrastructure code components. Most of our use cases for Cloudformation have moved over to AWS CDK but Cloudformation is really the underlying assembly language for infrastructure as code at AWS</p>
AWS Elasticache,Trial,Platforms,TRUE,<p>We're currently trying to leverage elasticache/redis as the backend for graphql subscriptions in our CDF framework. We hope to expand our use of this into distributed cache use cases as well</p>
MS SQL Server,Hold,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>MS SQL Server is one of the largest databases we use at Cvent today and is the primary relational database used behind large parts of app.cvent.com and related components. However, as we evolve we're putting a hold on continued expansion and use of this database as we prefer our relational databases move to AWS Aurora</p>"

Workflows Service,Hold,Platforms,FALSE,<p>A general purpose service for managing workflows. The initial intent of this service really never realized it's full potential and lacked wide adoption. There are various workflow engines across Cvent as well as cloud native solutions that we should probably look to first.</p>
PDF Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>The PDF service is how we render PDF documents from web applications. This allows our products to export reports as PDF, print badges and more</p>"
S3 Proxy Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>The S3 Proxy Service is the facilitator/proxy for all assets that we allow our customers to store in S3. It provides features such has virus scanning, multi-tenant separation, CDN, secure signed URLs</p>"
Identity Mapping Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>The identity mapping service is what we use to map Cvent customer accounts together under a unified mapping id. This was necessary because of aquisitions and variouus products having their own identifier of a cvent customer. This makes it difficult to have a unified auth/login system so we created this service to map all the various IDs together. When we build new applications/services then we want to use this generic identifier as the unified input abstraction to make it easier to integrate with other business units</p>
ID Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>The ID service was created as a service for generating globally unique identifiers that can be used across US and EUR for things like accountIds. It's important that these remain globally unique to avoid conflicts and it helps faciliate our tooling around identification of whether an ID belongs to US vs EUR</p>
Survey Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>The survey service provides a comprehensive api for building a survey product. The cvent survey product sits on top of this service and this service utilizes the question/answer service at the lowest level of abstraction</p>
Question/Answer Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>The lowest level of abstraction for questions/answers used throughout products</p>
Contacts Services,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>The contacts services is responsible for all API operations with respect to contacts used throughout Cvent products for marketing, invite lists, address books, etc</p>"

Scheduler Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>The scheduler service provides functionality to allow something to execute at a set interval or as a one time execution at a given time. The intent of this service is to provide features that allow us to replace the need for all Quartz based cronjobs</p>
Exchange Rate Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>The exchange rate service is a shared service for handling the different exchange rates. As Cvent customers are globally distributed and we support many locales, we also need to support various exchange rates depending on the product and region.</p>"
Specification Services,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>The specification service allows for a team to define a standard Open API specification and then uses that specification to integrate with our API platform, generate documentation and enforce best practices. We encourage all REST apis at Cvent to have a comprehensive open api and integrate with this service</p>"
AWS Comprehend,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,<p>The AWS Comprehend service has been experimented with for sentiment analysis and automatic catorization of data from user generated content like survey responses. There have been a few hackathon projects that have also experimented with this service but we haven't found the right use of this service in our products yet</p>
Image Lookup Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>The image lookup service allows us to efficiently store and retrieve images from CDN. Sometimes applications have poor network conditions or load hundreds of images on a single page. Whatever the reason, loading a web page as fast as possible is necessary to keep our customers  happy and engaged. This service helps us achieve that goal and we encourage all products at Cvent that load images to utilize this service</p>"
Limits Service,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>The limits service is a way to centrally control limits/capabilities of our products. Think of this like AWS limits or service quotas. All our products and apis should have limits. These limits help our ability to scale and grow without unexpected outages for our customers. We encourage all products at cvent to integrate with this service and expand our use of limits</p>
Cadre,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Cadre's is process that engineering teams can leverage to get feedback on technical designs and/or just sharing information with cross-functional teams. We often leverage this process for sharing and getting feedback on RFCs as well</p>
API First Design,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Cvent believes strongly in API First Design because it allows for iteration during the design phase. Getting the interface correct is the most important part of software development/design. We expect all APIs development to spend most of their time at this phase of development.</p>
Request for comments (RFCs),Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,<p>RFC is a process (and a wiki template) for putting together an idea or initiative to gather feedback from others.</p>
Design Documents,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Design documents is a fundamental part of SDLC where functional requirements and use cases get translated into a technical design for how we will build a solution. We expect that all teams are building design documents, reviewing them with architects, SRE and leads before writing code</p>"
Single Page Applications,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Single Page Applications (or SPA) is an architectural pattern where you load an applications UI once and then mutate state of the application on the fly without reloading the application. This is normally done by having the UI make API calls to the backend to change state or retrieve new data. At Cvent, many of our ReactJS applications follow this pattern. Gmail is a good example of an external SPA</p>"
Microservices,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Microservices is an architectural pattern where an application is broken up into discrete mini applications that can be built/deployed independentley and share nothing. This allows each component to be well understood, scaled, and modified independently from other teams</p>"
Monoliths,Hold,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Monoliths is an architectural pattern that normally involves a single application artifact and code repository. All development happens on the same artifact and the artifact gets deployed as a single unit. This is often a very efficient method for deliverying software when there's a limited number of teams with limited complexity. As the # of teams grow and the complexity increases it starts to hurt productivity. There are many other tradeoffs with this architectural style. At Cvent we recommend moving towards the microservice architectural pattern</p>
Mono Repositories,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Mono repositories is a technique that allows a group of related components to all be developed in a single code repository. This often allows for easier maintenance of releases between related components and can provide significant boosts in productivity for teams. Cvent has several mono-repositories like (nucleus, carina, nx, mono-java and other mini mono repositories for various products)</p>"
Micro Frontends,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,<p>Micro frontends is a technique that brings some of the advantages of microservices to the frontend. We're experimenting with various methods that allow us to leverage this technique where appropriate. We've also looked into tools like bit.dev as a mechanism for managing this across the enterprise</p>

maven,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>The primary java build tool for managing dependencies and various build/deploy best practices at Cvent</p>
gradle,Hold,Tools,FALSE,<p>A build tool used by the java community with heavy use in the Android community. At Cvent we prefer Maven for a variety of reasons</p>
cfn-lint,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,<p>The cfn-lint tool allows us to enforce best practices and security rules around all our cloudformation infrastructure as code. This tool is mandated by our build/deploy pipelines (CDK or native cloudformation)</p>
Karate,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>Karate is a test automation tool we're leveraging heavily for integration tests of all our REST/GraphQL APIs</p>
Postman,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>We leverage postman as a tool for developing and testing APIs. Cvent has a bucket of licenses available for users to collaborate/share postman collections</p>

Clover,Hold,Tools,FALSE,<p>A java code coverage tool that we've stopped using because it operates on source code and didn't support java 11 when we moved away. We recommend jacoco instead</p>
Cobertura,Hold,Tools,FALSE,"<p>A java code coverage tool that we've depreacated in favor of jacoco because of it's support by the community, support for java 11, integrations with IDEs and more</p>"
Release Bot,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>The release bot is a slack bot that helps us manage the queue of software changes that are going to production. This helps us coordinate who's next in line and avoids several changes happening at exactly the same time which often make it difficult to diagnose the exact cause of a failure</p>
Terraform,Hold,Tools,FALSE,<p>Terraform is another infrastructure as code platform provided by hashicorp. We've decided to leverage AWS native services where possible since it really doesn't provide any value over what cloudformation/cdk provides. We also would rather not learn a new custom DSL</p>
Serverless.com,Hold,Tools,FALSE,"<p>We experimented with serverless.com early on as way to manage our adoption of serverless on AWS. While it worked well for prototyping, it failed when it comes to security/compliance and flexibility. Instead, we've deferred to leveraging AWS CDK</p>"
apex.sh,Hold,Tools,FALSE,"<p>We experimented with apex early on as way to manage our adoption of serverless on AWS. While it worked well for prototyping, it failed when it comes to security/compliance and flexibility. Instead, we've deferred to leveraging AWS CDK</p>"

Datadog Logs,Adopt,Platforms,TRUE,<p>Datadog logs is an additional feature of datadlog that provides log aggregation. We're in the early phase of trying out datadog logs as a replacement for splunk logs. The intent right now is for application logs only.</p>
oktaws,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,<p>oktaws is a cli tool that authenticates via okta federation. We're preferring this tool over cvent-aws-cli because it works with all AWS SDKs</p>
AWS SAM,Hold,Tools,FALSE,"<p>AWS serverless application model (SAM) is another declarative approach to infrastructure as code, targetted at serverless to reduce boilerplate and improve on the developer experience. However, we've found it only works well in very isolated use cases and isn't flexible enough to work for longer term enterprise applications</p>"
LaunchDarkly,Assess,Platforms,FALSE,<p>We started looking for an off the shelf solution to replace the experiments service platform in 2019. LaunchDarkly seemed to be a clear leader in this space and is already in use at Social Tables. In 2020 we paused our effort to fully expand this platform to move this into trial phase due to budget constraints. We plan to pick this up again in 2022</p>
applitools,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,<p>Applitools allows us to run e2e test automation and easily identify visual failures as they occur</p>
pitest,Trial,Tools,TRUE,<p>A tool that helps you identify good tests from bad tests. This helps you avoid teams building tests that simply get code coverage without real test assertions</p>

Prisma,Hold,languages-and-frameworks,TRUE,<p>Prisma is an interesting ORM that works well with graphql + typescript but has several short comings when it comes to how it handles transactions and joins. Prisma also uses a sidecar process to execute queries that severely hinders observability tools like Datadog. The side car process complicates connection pooling and IAM authentication and the sql generated is un friendly to RDS Proxy making it an unsuitable tool for serverless deployments. The approach we've taken to handle IAM results in memory leaks. For this reason we’re putting this technology on Hold and looking for alternatives.</p>
